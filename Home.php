<h2>Corporate Headshots - London and the UK</h2>
<p1>I have photographed thousands of corporate headshots over the years and I have picked up a lot of tips 
along the way, enabling me to make the best of posing, expressions, lighting, crop, backgrounds, etc.</p1>
<h3>My Clients Say</h3>
<p1>Flawless photography, extremely capable, creative and brilliant to work with” - Micky Cohen, Portman Dental
“We are delighted with the images that Dan achieved. The photos actually surpassed our basic brief - the shots
 have captured a professional, well-organised learning environment while also portraying engagement, 
interaction, warmth and enjoyment. We couldn't have asked for more!” - Tommy Harrison, Market Research Society
The quality was uncompromised and the speed exceptional. Excellent service, and I would not hesitate to use him 
again.” Geoffrey Packer from EeStairs
"Dan did the photographs for my new website. I cannot rate him highly enough. He was thorough, artistic, lovely 
to work with. The lighting was great and I am delighted with the results." Christine Webber </p1>
<h3>Corporate Headshots</h3>
<p1>I can bring a mobile studio to your office, using plain backgrounds or the natural surroundings of your
 working environment. This means that there is very little downtime for you or your colleagues, and there is 
the opportunity to take business lifestyle shots as well.</p1>

<h2>Portrait Photography</h2>
<p1>I'm a highly experienced portrait photographer, and you are welcome to come to my studio or we can have 
an on-location shoot. 
Before the shoot, we can brainstorm the type of image you are looking to create, and if required, I will 
research the right locaions in which we can achieve that effect. Most shoots take between one and a half and 
two hours, and once the pictures are taken, I retouch the images, upload them into an online gallery and give 
you the option to download all the edited pictures, as well as providing them on disc. You can also 
choose the option to buy prints as well. To book me or if you have any questions, you can contact me on

<h2>Corporate Headshots - London and the UK</h2>
<p1>I'm a highly experienced corporate events photographer based in London, and I've been capturing 
conferences, parties, exhibitions and launches, for over a decade. My style is relaxed and friendly, 
and I photograph unobtrusively (I've been nicknamed the ninja) while making sure to tell the story in an
 engaging way, and photographing all the little details that makes each event special.</p1>

<p1>I use a combination of styles: from formal and set-up shots, to reportage photography. I provide 
all images edited on disc, including high res photos for print and jpgs for web use. I can provide a very fast 
turnaround, including edited images immediately after the event when needed. I also provide a 
password-protected online gallery in which you or your guests can download images and purchase prints or photo gifts.</p1>
<h3>Event Photography Rates</h3>

 all eventualities from late arrivals to the British weather! I can cover an event on my own or put together
